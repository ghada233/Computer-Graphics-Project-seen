> Batman city
---------------------------------------------------------------
1. Introduction and Description of the objects ofin the scene
----------------------------------------------------------------
In this project,wewill use computer graphic techniques thatwe
learned to create a "batman city" scene in JavaFX. All objects used
should be added to a groupwhich in turn added to the scene to be
visible. We use some elementssuch as a Sphere tomodel the ball
sun,rock, a light stick.The Box tomodel buildings, batman and
batman sign ,child and the road. Rectangle to trafficlight,soil.
Ovalforclouds and lightsin the trafficlight.Somemethods to
translate and rotate the scene, texturemapping tomap a texture
to the spheres, and light/light reflection tomake some
photorealismto the graphic. :earth_africa:

3. Requirements our project :round_pushpin:
----------------------------------------------------------------
> Important Elements:
Your project should contain at least one instance of each topic covered during the labs:

o Primitive shapes: points, lines, polygons, …etc.

o 3d shapes: cubes, teapots, cones, … etc.

o Colors: background, filling objects

o Modeling transformation or Clipping

o Keyboard/ or mouse events

o Lighting

o Reflection of light sources

o Texture mapping

>Project Description

The project consists of two parts as described below:

1) Generate a static computer image of a 2D / 3D scene with

a. a ground plane or floor with gridlines;

b. a sphere floating in the air;

c. an object of your choice other than a sphere (e.g. a teapot or a cube) sitting on the floor;

2) Make the 3D scene implemented in Part 1) interactive and dynamic:

a. when pressing the key “d”, the floating sphere would drop, bounce, and eventually stay on
the floor.

b. when pressing the left or right arrow key, the object of your choice would rotate for a
certain degree.

c. when left clicking the mouse anywhere in the space, both the sphere and the object of your
choice would move towards the present mouse location.

d. when pressing the key “r”, reset the scene to its initial state
